# dmenu

This fork of [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) is intended to apply the patch [Line height](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/line-height/) to the original dmenu in order to be used with my Qtile configuration.

However, this fork can be used everywhere, as it only applies a patch to modify the height of the prompt.
